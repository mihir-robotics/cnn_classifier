# Diabetes Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Classifier designed to predict whether a given patient has diabetes based on input medical data.

## Overview

The model is constructed using the Keras deep learning framework, utilizing Convolutional Neural Network architecture to process and analyze medical data for diabetes prediction.

## Features and Tools Used

- **Keras Framework:** The CNN model is implemented using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.
- **Pandas for Data Processing and Cleaning:** Pandas is used extensively for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **Feature Scaling with Standard Scaler:** Sklearn's Standard Scaler is utilized for feature scaling to normalize the data.
- **Previously Trained Models and Training Data:** The repository includes pre-trained models and the training dataset for reference and reproduction of results.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following structure:

- `models/`: Includes saved trained models in H5 format.
- `data/`: Contains the training dataset.
